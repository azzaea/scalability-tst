	RuntimeError: This job was passed a promise that wasn't yet resolved when it ran. The job 'CWLJob' sort kind-CWLJob/instance-wj6pkz0_ that fulfills this promise hasn't yet finished. This means that there aren't enough constraints to ensure the current job always runs after 'CWLJob' sort kind-CWLJob/instance-wj6pkz0_. Consider adding a follow-on indirection between this job and its parent, or adding this job as a child/follow-on of 'CWLJob' sort kind-CWLJob/instance-wj6pkz0_.
